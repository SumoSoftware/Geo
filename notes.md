GIS  Geographic information system.  
An organized collection of computer hardware, software, geographic data, and personnel designed to efficiently capture, store, update, 
manipulate, analyze, and display all forms of geographically referenced information.  Outputs include cartographic displays, spatial 
analysis, and tabular reports.  A GIS uses geography or space as a common key between data sets.  lnformation is linked only if it 
relates to the same geographical area.  It is an analysis tool that allows analysis and display of spatial relationships between 
mapped features.  

Questions GIS can provide information on:  
	location- What is at X location?  
	condition- Where is X located?  
	amount/extent- How much X is present?  
	trends- What has changed since ..?  
	patterns- What spatial patterns exist?  
	modeling- What if ....

go readup on GDAL
GDAL: [GIS software] Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a C++ library for reading and writing raster geospatial data formats, implementing common GIS operations (unions, intersections, joins, clipping, etc.) with command line utilities. It supports old hardware and operating systems and requires very low amounts of memory. 

GRASS GIS: [software] GRASS GIS (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) was developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers and is a free and open source GIS software. GRASS GIS is highly used in academic institutions with over 400 modules for GIS analysis.
